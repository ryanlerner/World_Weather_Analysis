# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose
  This analysis was created for users to specify their weather preferences, and to generate potential travel destinations based on these preferences. We also recommended hotels within their preferred travel destinations by using Google APIs. In order to get this data, we pulled 1500 random coordinates and found the nearest cities to these coordinates with the citipy module. We then imported the weather data with the OpenWeatherMap API, and produced several google maps images with informative markers and potential driving routes.
